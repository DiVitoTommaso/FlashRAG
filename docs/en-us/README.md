FlashRAG is a Python toolkit for the reproduction and development of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) research. Our toolkit includes 36 pre-processed benchmark RAG datasets and 16 state-of-the-art RAG algorithms. Our features are as follows:

- **Extensive and Customizable Framework**: Includes essential components for RAG scenarios such as retrievers, rerankers, generators, and compressors, allowing for flexible assembly of complex pipelines.

- **Comprehensive Benchmark Datasets**: A collection of 36 pre-processed RAG benchmark datasets to test and validate RAG models' performances.

- **Pre-implemented Advanced RAG Algorithms**: Features 16 advancing RAG algorithms with reported results, based on our framework. Easily reproducing results under different settings.

- **Efficient Preprocessing Stage**: Simplifies the RAG workflow preparation by providing various scripts like corpus processing for retrieval, retrieval index building, and pre-retrieval of documents.

- **Optimized Execution**: The library's efficiency is enhanced with tools like vLLM, FastChat for LLM inference acceleration, and Faiss for vector index management.

- **Easy to Use UI** : We have developed a very easy to use UI to easily and quickly configure and experience the RAG baselines we have implemented, as well as run evaluation scripts on a visual interface.
